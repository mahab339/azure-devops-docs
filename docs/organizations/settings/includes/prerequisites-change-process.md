## Prerequisites

- To create, delete or edit a process, you must be a member of the [**Project Collection Administrators** group](../../security/change-organization-collection-level-permissions.md), or have the collection-level permissions **Create process**, **Delete process**, **Edit process**, or **Delete a field from organization**. For more information, see [Set permissions and access for work tracking, Customize an inherited process](../../security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md#customize-an-inherited-process).
- Even if you have **Basic** or **Stakeholder** access, you can still change a process if someone gives you permissions to do so. 
- To update Kanban boards, you must be the team administrator or a member of the [**Project Administrators** group](../../security/change-project-level-permissions.md)
- To update and change the type of your existing work items, you must be a member of the project.
